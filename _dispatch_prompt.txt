## Spec: FINISH the Easy Apply Cleanup [CONTINUATION]

### Context
Previous task ab450992 stopped halfway. Continue and complete ALL remaining work.

### Check What's Done, Finish What's Not

#### 1. Verify/Complete `src/agent/linkedin_flow.py`
- `_process_with_claude_fallback()` should be DELETED
- All Claude/FormProcessor imports removed
- `apply()` should ONLY use `_process_easy_apply()` or return SKIPPED

#### 2. Verify/Complete `src/agent/external_flow.py`
- FormProcessor fallback at end of `apply()` should be DELETED
- After Indeed Easy Apply check, everything else returns SKIPPED
- Remove dead imports: `DomService`, `ActionRunner`, `FormProcessor`, `ClaudeAgent`

#### 3. Verify/Complete `src/agent/form_processor.py`
- Remove `_process_with_handler()` method
- Remove ATS imports
- If nothing uses this class anymore, DELETE THE FILE

#### 4. Check for broken imports
- Search for anything importing `FormProcessor` - update or remove
- Search for anything importing from `src/ats/` - if nothing, delete the directory

#### 5. Run tests
```
pytest tests/ -x -q
```
Fix any import errors or test failures.

### DO NOT STOP UNTIL
- All Claude fallbacks are removed
- All ATS handler code is removed or isolated
- Tests pass
- The flows are: Easy Apply → deterministic filler → SKIP on unknown

## Code Standards

Write code that looks inevitable. Follow these constraints:

**Restraint**
- Solve it in one file if possible
- No abstractions until the third time you need them
- No classes if functions will do
- No inheritance - use composition

**Functions**
- Max 25 lines, aim for 15
- One level of nesting max
- Name describes exactly what it does: `extract_billable_hours()` not `process_data()`
- Input → transform → output. No side effects unless that's the point.

**Files**
- Max 200 lines for new files
- One clear responsibility
- If you're adding a second "system" to a file, stop and split

**No Ceremony**
- No AbstractFactory, no IServiceProvider, no Manager classes
- No code "just in case" - solve the actual problem
- Delete commented-out code, don't keep it

**Data**
- Use dataclasses or plain dicts, not classes with only __init__ and getters
- Data flows obviously - reader should predict what happens next
- No global state

The best code is code you delete. Every line is a liability.
