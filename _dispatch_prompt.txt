Fix GUI freezing issue in Mater-Browser. The GUI becomes unresponsive during job applications and scraping operations.

## Context
- GUI is in `src/gui/dashboard.py` and `src/gui/app.py`
- Entry point is `gui.py` in project root
- The automation runner and application agent are doing blocking Playwright operations on the main thread
- This causes the GUI to freeze while jobs are being processed

## Requirements
1. Move all blocking operations (job scraping, application flow, browser automation) to background threads/workers
2. Use Qt's QThread or Python's threading with proper signal/slot communication back to the GUI
3. Keep the GUI responsive - user should be able to see progress, stop the bot, scroll logs, etc.
4. Ensure thread safety - Playwright page objects should only be accessed from their creating thread
5. Use signals/callbacks to update the GUI from background workers

## Key files to examine
- `src/gui/dashboard.py` - main dashboard UI
- `src/gui/app.py` - app initialization
- `src/automation/runner.py` - automation loop that processes jobs
- `gui.py` - entry point

## Constraints
- Don't change the core application logic, just move it off the main thread
- Maintain existing logging behavior
- Keep the same user-facing functionality
