Update ActionPlan model and form_processor to handle the new page_type field from Claude responses.

## Problem
The prompt now returns a page_type field ("job_listing", "form", "confirmation", "unknown") but the model and processor don't use it.

## Files to modify
- `src/agent/actions.py`
- `src/agent/form_processor.py`

## actions.py changes

Add page_type field to ActionPlan:

```python
from typing import Literal, Union, Optional

# ... keep all existing action classes unchanged ...

class ActionPlan(BaseModel):
    """Ordered list of actions to execute."""
    
    page_type: Literal["job_listing", "form", "confirmation", "unknown"] = "unknown"
    reasoning: str
    actions: list[Action]
    needs_more_pages: bool = False
```

## form_processor.py changes

After getting the plan from Claude, add page_type handling. Find where `plan = self._claude.analyze_form(...)` is called and add logic after it:

1. If page_type == "confirmation":
   - Log "Claude detected confirmation page"
   - Return ApplicationResult with SUCCESS status immediately
   - Don't execute any actions

2. If page_type == "job_listing" and len(plan.actions) == 1 and plan.actions[0].action == "click":
   - Log "Job listing page - clicking Apply"
   - Execute the single click action
   - Continue loop (expect redirect to actual form)

3. If page_type == "form":
   - Proceed normally with execution

4. If page_type == "unknown" and len(plan.actions) == 0:
   - Delegate to ZeroActionsHandler as currently done

Add this logic right after `plan = self._claude.analyze_form(...)` and before the existing zero-actions handling.

## Code standards
- Static typing everywhere
- Max 25 lines per function - extract helpers if needed
- Use logging module

Write clean, scalable, modular, efficient code. Follow single responsibility principle. Do not repeat yourself. Use consistent naming conventions. No unnecessary comments.
