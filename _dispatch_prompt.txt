# Spec-Driven Implementation

## CRITICAL: TRUST THE SPEC

The specification below is COMPLETE. Do not:
- Read README, ARCHITECTURE, or documentation files
- Search for patterns or conventions in the codebase
- Explore directory structures
- Read files unrelated to your implementation

Only read files that:
1. You need to import from (check the target path's neighbors)
2. Contain types/classes referenced in the interface

The spec tells you exactly what to build. Trust it.

## CIRCUIT BREAKER

If you have made 8+ file reads without writing any code, STOP.
You are exploring instead of implementing. The spec is complete.
Write the implementation now with what you know.

## THE SPECIFICATION

# Specification: FixIntegrationTests
Tier: HOTFIX

## Description
Fix the 9 failing tests in test_failureloggerintegration.py. All failures are caused by mock page content triggering payment page detection, which aborts before failure logging happens.

## Must Do
- Fix all 9 failing tests to not trigger payment detection
- Keep the test intent intact (still testing failure logging)
- Don't modify production code - only test file

## Validation
- Tests: pytest tests/test_failureloggerintegration.py -v --tb=short

## Target Path
tests/test_failureloggerintegration.py

## YOUR TASK

**Tier: HOTFIX** - Minimal scope, fast iteration.
- Focus on the specific bug/issue only
- 1-3 targeted tests maximum

### Step 1: Implement the Interface

Implementation location: `tests/test_failureloggerintegration.py`

Implementation Rules:
1. Follow interface signatures EXACTLY as specified
2. Handle all edge cases as specified
3. Ensure preconditions are checked
4. Ensure postconditions are satisfied
5. Respect all 'Must Not Do' constraints

### Step 2: Write Tests

Test file location: `tests/test_fixintegrationtests.py`

After implementing, write tests that verify contract and behavior:

**Must Do Tests:**
- Write one test for each item in the 'Must Do' section
- Tests should verify the behavior/contract, not implementation details

Test Code Requirements:
- Use pytest fixtures for shared setup
- Include full type hints
- Use descriptive test names
- Keep tests focused and independent

### Step 3: Validate

Run validation: `pytest tests/test_failureloggerintegration.py -v --tb=short`

Iterate until all tests pass.
Maximum iterations: 5

Write clean, scalable, modular, efficient code. Follow single responsibility principle. Do not repeat yourself. Use consistent naming conventions. No unnecessary comments.
