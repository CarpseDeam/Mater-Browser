Fix the form processor to always advance forms, and strengthen the prompt.

## Problem
Claude returned only 1 action (checkbox) without clicking Next button. Form had pre-filled fields so Claude thought it was done. Bot hung waiting for something that never happened.

## Files to modify
- `src/agent/prompts.py`
- `src/agent/form_processor.py`

## prompts.py changes

In SYSTEM_PROMPT, find the CRITICAL RULES section and make rule about button clicks much stronger:

```python
## CRITICAL RULES

1. Use ONLY refs from the provided elements — never invent refs
2. For dropdowns, use the EXACT text of an available option
3. For file uploads, use "resume" as the file value
4. **MANDATORY: Your actions list MUST end with a click on Next/Submit/Continue button**
   - Even if all fields are pre-filled, you MUST click the advancement button
   - Even if you only check one checkbox, you MUST click Next after
   - The ONLY exception is page_type "confirmation" (return empty actions)
   - If you don't click a button, the form will hang forever
5. If page looks like confirmation, return empty actions with page_type "confirmation"
6. Do not click multiple buttons — pick ONE primary action button
7. Do not fill the same field twice
8. Pre-filled fields do NOT mean you're done — you still need to click Next
```

Also add a new section after CRITICAL RULES:

```python
## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

- Returning actions without a final button click (causes hang)
- Thinking pre-filled fields mean the page is complete (it's not until you click Next)
- Returning 0 actions on a form page (always at least click Next)
- Clicking "Save" instead of "Next" or "Continue"
```

## form_processor.py changes

Add a failsafe after getting the plan from Claude. If the plan has actions but doesn't end with a click on a likely submit/next button, automatically append one.

1. Add new helper method `_ensure_plan_has_submit(self, plan: ActionPlan, dom_state: DomState) -> ActionPlan`:
   - If plan.page_type == "confirmation", return plan unchanged
   - If plan.actions is empty, return plan unchanged (let zero-actions handler deal with it)
   - Check if last action is a click
   - If last action is NOT a click, or if it's a click but not on a button element, find the Next/Submit button and append a click action
   - Use dom_state.elements to find button with text matching: next, continue, submit, review, apply (case insensitive)
   - If found, append ClickAction(ref=button.ref) to plan.actions
   - Log when auto-appending: "Auto-appending click on {button_text} button"

2. Add helper method `_find_submit_button(self, dom_state: DomState) -> Optional[DomElement]`:
   - Look through dom_state.elements for buttons/links with submit-like text
   - Priority order: "submit" > "next" > "continue" > "review" > "apply"
   - Check element.tag in ("button", "a", "input") or element.type in ("submit", "button")
   - Check element.text, element.buttonText, element.label for keywords
   - Return the best match or None

3. Call `_ensure_plan_has_submit()` right after getting plan from Claude, before the page_type handling:
   ```python
   plan = self._claude.analyze_form(dom_state, self._profile, self._dom_service)
   if plan:
       plan = self._ensure_plan_has_submit(plan, dom_state)
   ```

4. Import ClickAction at top of file:
   ```python
   from .actions import ActionPlan, ClickAction
   ```

## Code standards
- Static typing everywhere
- Max 25 lines per function - split into helpers
- Use logging module

Write clean, scalable, modular, efficient code. Follow single responsibility principle. Do not repeat yourself. Use consistent naming conventions. No unnecessary comments.
