Update config/filters.yaml with these specific changes:

1. Change `min_score` from 0.5 to 0.3 under scoring section

2. In title_exclusions.seniority, REMOVE these entries (user has 6+ years, can do these):
   - "lead"
   
3. In role_exclusions.senior, REMOVE these entries:
   - "lead engineer"
   - "lead developer"

4. Keep ALL frontend, mobile, .NET, Java, PHP, Ruby, Go exclusions - user is Python backend only

5. Keep junior/intern/entry exclusions - user is mid-to-senior level

Do NOT remove any frontend, mobile, or non-Python stack exclusions. Those stay.

## Code Standards

Write code that looks inevitable. Follow these constraints:

**Restraint**
- Solve it in one file if possible
- No abstractions until the third time you need them
- No classes if functions will do
- No inheritance - use composition

**Functions**
- Max 25 lines, aim for 15
- One level of nesting max
- Name describes exactly what it does: `extract_billable_hours()` not `process_data()`
- Input → transform → output. No side effects unless that's the point.

**Files**
- Max 200 lines for new files
- One clear responsibility
- If you're adding a second "system" to a file, stop and split

**No Ceremony**
- No AbstractFactory, no IServiceProvider, no Manager classes
- No code "just in case" - solve the actual problem
- Delete commented-out code, don't keep it

**Data**
- Use dataclasses or plain dicts, not classes with only __init__ and getters
- Data flows obviously - reader should predict what happens next
- No global state

The best code is code you delete. Every line is a liability.
