## Task: Loosen Job Filters to Increase Application Volume

### Context
The bot is rejecting 60-90% of jobs with `missing_keyword` reason. The required_keywords filter demands "python" appear in title+description, but LinkedIn scrapes have truncated/empty descriptions. Valid Python jobs get killed.

### File: `config/filters.yaml`

Make these changes:

1. **Remove the required_keywords filter** - Comment out or delete the entire `required:` section:
```yaml
# required:
#   keywords:
#     - "python"
#   keyword_in_title: false
```

2. **Ensure "python" is in title_keywords** so jobs mentioning Python in title get score boost (not required, just boosted). It should already be there, verify it exists:
```yaml
title_keywords:
  - "python"
  - "backend"
  # ... rest
```

3. **Add "python" to positive_signals** if not already there, so description mentions boost score.

### File: `src/scraper/filter_config.py`

Handle the case where `required` section is missing or empty:

Around line 103 where required keywords are loaded:
```python
required = data.get("required", {})
```

Make sure it handles empty/missing gracefully:
```python
required = data.get("required", {})
required_keywords_raw = required.get("keywords", [])
# Filter out empty strings, handle None
required_keywords = [k.lower() for k in required_keywords_raw if k] if required_keywords_raw else []
```

### File: `src/scraper/scorer.py`

Make the keyword check skip if no keywords configured. Around line 127:
```python
if self._config.required_keywords:
    search_text = title_lower if self._config.keyword_in_title else combined
    if not any(kw in search_text for kw in self._config.required_keywords):
        return FilterResult(...)
```

This already checks `if self._config.required_keywords:` so it should work if the list is empty. Just verify the logic is correct.

### Expected Outcome
- Jobs no longer rejected for `missing_keyword` when required_keywords is empty
- Score-based filtering still works (title_keywords, positive_signals boost relevant jobs)
- min_score threshold (0.5) still filters truly irrelevant jobs

### Testing
After changes, verify:
1. Config loads without error
2. Jobs pass filter when no required_keywords set
3. Jobs with "python" in title still get higher scores

## Code Standards

Write code that looks inevitable. Follow these constraints:

**Restraint**
- Solve it in one file if possible
- No abstractions until the third time you need them
- No classes if functions will do
- No inheritance - use composition

**Functions**
- Max 25 lines, aim for 15
- One level of nesting max
- Name describes exactly what it does: `extract_billable_hours()` not `process_data()`
- Input → transform → output. No side effects unless that's the point.

**Files**
- Max 200 lines for new files
- One clear responsibility
- If you're adding a second "system" to a file, stop and split

**No Ceremony**
- No AbstractFactory, no IServiceProvider, no Manager classes
- No code "just in case" - solve the actual problem
- Delete commented-out code, don't keep it

**Data**
- Use dataclasses or plain dicts, not classes with only __init__ and getters
- Data flows obviously - reader should predict what happens next
- No global state

The best code is code you delete. Every line is a liability.
