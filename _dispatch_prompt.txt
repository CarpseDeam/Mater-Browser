Add fallback answers for unknown text fields and textareas. Don't leave them blank - put SOMETHING.

## In `src/agent/linkedin_form_filler.py`:

When filling text inputs or textareas and there's no answer from answer_engine:

### For textareas (long form questions):
```python
FALLBACK_TEXTAREA = "Please refer to my resume and LinkedIn profile for detailed information on my experience and qualifications."
```

### For text inputs (short answers):
```python
FALLBACK_TEXT = "See resume"
```

### Implementation:
In `_fill_text_inputs()` and `_fill_textareas()`:
- If answer_engine returns None/empty, use the fallback
- Log it as: `"Using fallback for unknown question: {question}"`
- Still fill the field and continue

This way NO text field is ever left empty. Always put something.

## Code Standards

Write code that looks inevitable. Follow these constraints:

**Restraint**
- Solve it in one file if possible
- No abstractions until the third time you need them
- No classes if functions will do
- No inheritance - use composition

**Functions**
- Max 25 lines, aim for 15
- One level of nesting max
- Name describes exactly what it does: `extract_billable_hours()` not `process_data()`
- Input → transform → output. No side effects unless that's the point.

**Files**
- Max 200 lines for new files
- One clear responsibility
- If you're adding a second "system" to a file, stop and split

**No Ceremony**
- No AbstractFactory, no IServiceProvider, no Manager classes
- No code "just in case" - solve the actual problem
- Delete commented-out code, don't keep it

**Data**
- Use dataclasses or plain dicts, not classes with only __init__ and getters
- Data flows obviously - reader should predict what happens next
- No global state

The best code is code you delete. Every line is a liability.
