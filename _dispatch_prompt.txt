The bot is bailing out when it encounters unknown questions. This is wrong. It should fill what it can and SUBMIT ANYWAY.

## Problem
In `src/agent/linkedin_flow.py`, when there are unknown questions, it logs them and SKIPS the job:
```
WARNING: Skipping job - unknown questions: [...]
```

This is unacceptable. The bot should:
1. Fill everything it knows
2. Leave unknown fields empty OR fill with a generic response
3. SUBMIT ANYWAY

## Changes needed:

### 1. In `src/agent/linkedin_flow.py`:
- Remove the logic that skips/fails jobs due to unknown questions
- Just log the unknown questions as INFO, not WARNING
- Continue with submission regardless

### 2. In `src/agent/linkedin_form_filler.py`:
- When a field has no answer, skip it silently (don't add to unknown list that causes failure)
- For textareas with no answer, optionally fill with a generic: "Please see my resume for details."
- The filler should return success even if some fields couldn't be filled

### 3. The goal is FIRE AND FORGET:
- Fill what we can
- Submit
- Move on
- Never stop because of missing answers

Find where the unknown questions cause the application to fail/skip and remove that behavior. The bot should be aggressive about submitting.

## Code Standards

Write code that looks inevitable. Follow these constraints:

**Restraint**
- Solve it in one file if possible
- No abstractions until the third time you need them
- No classes if functions will do
- No inheritance - use composition

**Functions**
- Max 25 lines, aim for 15
- One level of nesting max
- Name describes exactly what it does: `extract_billable_hours()` not `process_data()`
- Input → transform → output. No side effects unless that's the point.

**Files**
- Max 200 lines for new files
- One clear responsibility
- If you're adding a second "system" to a file, stop and split

**No Ceremony**
- No AbstractFactory, no IServiceProvider, no Manager classes
- No code "just in case" - solve the actual problem
- Delete commented-out code, don't keep it

**Data**
- Use dataclasses or plain dicts, not classes with only __init__ and getters
- Data flows obviously - reader should predict what happens next
- No global state

The best code is code you delete. Every line is a liability.
