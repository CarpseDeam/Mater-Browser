## Spec: Fix Indeed Easy Apply - Review Page Submit + Pattern Matching [CRITICAL]

### Context
The bot is hitting Indeed Easy Apply pages but failing:
1. Lands on `smartapply.indeed.com/.../review-module` but can't find submit button
2. AnswerEngine matched "Voluntary Self-Identification of Disability" to `personal.website` - pattern matching is broken

### Problem 1: Review Page Submit Button

In `src/agent/indeed_form_filler.py`, the CONTINUE_PATTERNS are:
```python
CONTINUE_PATTERNS = [
    '[data-testid="ia-continueButton"]',
    '[data-testid*="continue" i]',
    '[data-testid*="hp-continue-button"]',
    'button:has-text("Continue")',
    'button:has-text("Submit")',
    'button:has-text("Apply")',
    'button:has-text("Review")',
    'button[type="submit"]',
    '.ia-continueButton',
]
```

These don't match the actual Indeed review page submit button. Research Indeed's actual selectors:
- The review page has "Submit your application" or "Submit application" button
- May have data-testid like `ia-submitButton` or similar
- Try: `button:has-text("Submit your application")`, `button:has-text("Submit application")`
- Try: `[data-testid*="submit"]`, `[data-tn-element="submit"]`

### Fix Required in `src/agent/indeed_form_filler.py`:
1. Add more submit button selectors to CONTINUE_PATTERNS
2. Add `is_review_page()` method that checks if URL contains "review"
3. In `click_continue()`, if on review page, prioritize submit-specific selectors

### Problem 2: Pattern Order in AnswerEngine

In `src/agent/answer_engine.py`, patterns are matched in order. The question "Voluntary Self-Identification of Disability" matched `personal.website` somehow.

The disability pattern should be:
```python
(r"disability\s*status|disability|accommodation", "dropdowns", "disability_status"),
```

But it's in `eeo_patterns` which comes AFTER `personal_patterns`.

### Fix Required in `src/agent/answer_engine.py`:
1. Move EEO patterns (gender, race, veteran, disability) to the TOP of the pattern list - they need to match before personal info patterns
2. Make the disability pattern more specific: `r"self.?identification.*disability|disability\s*status|disability|accommodation"`
3. Add explicit skip for questions containing "self-identification" that should default to "Prefer not to say" or "Decline to answer"

### Additional: Handle EEO/Demographic Questions
Indeed's demographic questions are voluntary. The bot should:
1. Detect these questions by keywords: "voluntary", "self-identification", "demographic", "eeo", "equal opportunity"
2. Select "Decline to self-identify" or "Prefer not to say" option when available
3. If no decline option, skip the question (don't guess at personal demographics)

### Test
Run: `pytest tests/ -x -q`

### Code Standards
- Static typing everywhere
- Guard clauses
- logging module only

## Code Standards

Write code that looks inevitable. Follow these constraints:

**Restraint**
- Solve it in one file if possible
- No abstractions until the third time you need them
- No classes if functions will do
- No inheritance - use composition

**Functions**
- Max 25 lines, aim for 15
- One level of nesting max
- Name describes exactly what it does: `extract_billable_hours()` not `process_data()`
- Input → transform → output. No side effects unless that's the point.

**Files**
- Max 200 lines for new files
- One clear responsibility
- If you're adding a second "system" to a file, stop and split

**No Ceremony**
- No AbstractFactory, no IServiceProvider, no Manager classes
- No code "just in case" - solve the actual problem
- Delete commented-out code, don't keep it

**Data**
- Use dataclasses or plain dicts, not classes with only __init__ and getters
- Data flows obviously - reader should predict what happens next
- No global state

The best code is code you delete. Every line is a liability.
